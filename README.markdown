# puppet-play #

This module aims to handle installation and deployment features for 
Play 2 Framework apps (http://www.playframework.com/).

Specifically, it provides:

- Play Framework runtime installation (optional)
- Play application deployment from Nexus repository (play runtime not needed)

At the moment, only tested on Ubuntu 12.04.

Note: also depends on the nexus module which is not yet available to the general public.
